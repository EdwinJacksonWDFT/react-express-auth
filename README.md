# react-express-auth

This repository is an example of how to implement token authentication with create-react-app and an express back-end.

the steps are as follows:
- clone the repository
- run `npm install && npm start` in both the front-end and back-end folders
- open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.
- login with the credentials username: `shrek`, password: `changeisgood`
- Open your browser's console, and view the `Application` tab to see the token.
- you can also refresh the page to see the state changes

optional:
- close your browser and stop the front-end app
- start up the front-end app again and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

notice how the application is different from the first time you loaded up
